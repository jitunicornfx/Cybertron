# Cybertron
A revised retro theme for Obsidian inspired by Cyberpunk 2077, Dynalist, Tron, The Terminator, Synthwave, and Keanu Reeves

## Commentary

This is my true love. You will either love this theme, or avoid it at all costs.

Although itâ€™s inspired by the retro craze, itâ€™s crazy how useful it actually is. I get an incredible amount of work accomplished in it. As the creator of Cybertron once said:

> I do both my creative and analytical work in Cybertron.

It derives inspiration from:
1. Dynalist
2. Cyberpunk 2077
3. Synthwave
4. [[Keanu Reeves]]
5. The Terminator

## Cool Aspects
While stylized, I actually find Cybertron to be extremely practical. It seems to encourage creativity. 

###### Notables
- Dark mode only
- **Bold** has its own color
- *Italics* has its own color
- It's preferred that you use the plugin Sliding Panes

### Testing it out
I use **Bold Words** for calling out nouny things (most of the time), and I'll use *italics* for drawing emphasis to words (nothing out of the ordinary there).
